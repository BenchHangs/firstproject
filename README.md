# Pokemon Go Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis:

### Find the formula for CP

The purpose of this analysis is to see which statistics correlates the most to a Pokemon's CP in the game Pokemon GO. I am a lifelong Pokemon fan who often look at the statistics of the Pokemon to determine which Pokemon is best to build a strong team. When Pokemon Go was released, they introduced a new statistics called CP, which had me wondering what makes up the CP. 

### Prediction of the 6th Generation Pokemon's CP

I also am interested to predict the CP of the Pokemons that will be released in the near future. This will help me anticipate which pokemons will be strong upon release.

### Analysis of the Strongest Pokemon Type in Pokemon GO

Upon analyzing the CP and statistics of the Pokemons, I want to see which type of Pokemon is the strongest.
