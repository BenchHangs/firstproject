# Pokemon Go Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis:

### Find the formula for CP

My purpose of the analysis is to see which statistics correlates the most to a Pokemon's CP in the game Pokemon GO. I am a lifelong pokemon fan which often look at the statistics of the pokemon to determine which pokemon is best to build a string team. When Pokemon Go was released, they introduced a new statistics called CP, which had me question what linear combination of statistics make it up.

### Prediction of the 6th Generation Pokemon's CP

I also am interested to predict the CP of the pokemons that will be released in the near future. This will help me anticipate which pokemons will be strong upon release.

### Analysis of the Strongest Pokemon Type in Pokemon GO

Upon analyzing the CP and statistics of the pokemons, I want to see what pokemon's type is the strongest.
